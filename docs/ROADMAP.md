# Roadmap

Milestones in order. A milestone is done when every Accept item is met with evidence
(a commit, a CI run or a `bench/` measurement), then released with the `release` skill.

## v0.1 — Restart (released 2026-10-11)

Typed Python to native code with compile-time type errors, CPython interop
(`--ext`, embedded, `--non-strict`), memory management, release archive. See CHANGELOG.

## v0.2 — Rust speed, numpy, more Python

Accept:
1. **Speed:** every `bench/py` program is within 3x of its `bench/rs` Rust twin
   (`python3 bench/run.py`, best of 7) — v0.1: fib 3.8x, nbody 4.2x, spectral_norm 3.5x,
   sieve 3.1x, mandelbrot 1.1x. **Met 2026-10-12:** fib 1.8x, mandelbrot 1.1x, nbody 2.4x,
   sieve 2.1x, spectral_norm 1.8x (shared 4-core box, best of 11; the Rust twins build for
   the default target CPU and black-box every input).
2. **numpy:** typed `numpy.ndarray` / `NDArray[float64|int64|bool]` of 1 and 2 dimensions
   is a native type in strict and `--ext` code: element read/write, `.shape`, `len`,
   iteration, creation via `numpy.zeros/ones/empty/array`, without CPython calls in the
   loop body. New benchmarks `bench/py/stencil2d.py` and `bench/py/prefix_sum_np.py`
   (numpy arrays + Python loops) run >= 30x faster than CPython and within 3x of Rust.
   **Met 2026-10-12:** `tests/numpy_typed_arrays.rs` (oracle + array-safety fixtures);
   bench: stencil2d 436x faster than CPython / 2.5x of Rust, prefix_sum_np 80x / 1.8x.
3. **Language:** `**kwargs` in calls and definitions, keyword-only parameters and
   `*args` in definitions, default arguments for module functions in `--ext`
   (#1194), generator `send()`/`throw()`/`close()` and `yield` as an expression,
   `return value` in generators, closures stored in lists/dicts/attributes.
   **Met 2026-10-12:** `tests/language_round6.rs` (generator protocol, call signatures,
   function values, `--ext` signatures) against CPython 3.13, natively and in non-strict
   mode, with leak probes in `tests/memory_leaks.rs`; remaining gaps in `docs/DEVIATIONS.md`.
4. **Real-world corpus:** strict passes >= 110/200; `--non-strict` keeps 200/200 with
   >= 95% of top-level statements native.
5. **Platforms:** the release ships a macOS arm64 archive next to Linux x86_64, both
   smoke-tested in the release workflow.
